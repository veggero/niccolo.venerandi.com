        <p>[19/7/17] A differenza di quanto molti pensano, nelle partite piu' lunghe di uno, quando il mazzo da cui pescare le carte si assottiglia fino a scomparire, non si puo' semplicemente prendere le carte gettate durante la partita e girarle per essere riusate. Ogni carta e' infatti collegata alla successiva, e questi legami vanno spezzati, mescolando ogni singola carta: tagliare il mazzo non bastera'.<br>Cosi', quando la nostra partita inizio' ad allungarsi, io, avendo gia' vinto, ed essendo il mazziere ufficiale, presi le carte e iniziai a uccidere uno a uno i legami formati, con un semplice algoritmo: metto le carte in cinque mazzetti diversi, gettando una carta in ogni mazzetto e passando al successivo. In questo modo garantisci una giocata perfetta.<br>E mentre faccio questo, penso, ridacchiando, "I'm actually destroying our play history". Ma, posando le successive carte, mi rendo conto che non e' cosi', in realta potrei ricostruire la nostra partita partendo dalle carte mescolate. Ma mentre penso questo, finisco le carte in mano e riunisco i cinque mazzetti in uno, e mi rendo conto di non aver specificato in che ordine i cinque mazzetti debbano essere impilati: ho inserito un valore casuale. I valori casuali non distruggono i dati iniziali, ma li corrompono, portando il risultato del processo di ricostruzione da la nostra partita a più partite con un valore di probabilita'. Mentre penso questo ho finito nuovamente di mescolare le carte, ma le riprendo in mano, e inizio a formare altri cinque mazzetti. Il mio cervello e' stimolato. Ma nel farlo alzo leggermente lo sguardo, e vedo gli alri giocatori guardarmi male, aspettando le carte per poter giocare. "Scusatemi", dico, poso il mazzetto corrotto, ne prendo uno inutilizzato e mi dileguo.<br>Inizio a disporre le carte sul tavolo, iniziando a postulare postulati, sfidandomi a crearne che possano stimolare un gioco interessante. Metto le carte in una matrice bidimensionale, sostituendo le carte adiacenti con un numero tra le due, aspettandomi una matrice finale la cui media sarebbe stata congruente alla media del range delle carte usate, trovando però velocemente una scappatoia per continuare all'infinito, e il mio cervello inizia a ingranare, finalmente attivo. Mi alzo e esco. Inizio a girare alla strada in cui non ho gia' girato piu' a destra, pronto a girare il mondo con quel semplice algoritmo. Inizio a ricordarmi quando lo facevo abitualmente, per vedere quanto potevo spingere il mio calcolatore. E mi rendo conto che avevo smesso per stare in mezzo alle persone. Avevo messo da parte i giochini matematici, per divertirmi con altre persone, abbandonandomi a banalita' e luoghi comuni.<br>Ma, a un certo punto, svolto a destra e vedo una ragazzina, con un maglione viola, pantaloni verdi con alcuni tagli, e una maglietta con un motivo di fiori. E mi ricordo il vero motivo per cui avevo abbandonato la matematica a favore delle persone.<br>"Hey, Yara!".</p>
        <p>[18/7/17] It's one o'clock in the morning. Our bodies are in our camping beds, and with ours I mean mine's, Marghe's and Eleonora's. We all got a little of two hours of sleep in the last 30 hours, and even though me and Ele are fine, Marghe is not, at all. Her brain is gone.<br>"Our taxi is here", she says, lying in her bed. We watch her, shocked. "I meant - she clarify - is it already morning?". Weird silence here. "Ehm, it's one o'clock in the morning actually". She doesn't seem understanding. "Look, - I say - you had just two hours of sleep in the last 30 hours, go sleeping". She answers, "Two hours? I though eight". Is she kidding?, I aks myself.<br>"Why are you here?" she asks me. Her sister answer for me: "We let him get in, didn't we?". "Ah - Marghe keep asking, confused - weren't we angry at him?". "He said sorry, we're fine. Look, you look terrible right now, just sleep". "Why are you speaking English?" she asks (nds, this whole thing happened in Italian). "We aren't... this is Italian". I'm really getting worried.<br>"Marghe - Ele says - I'm now really worried you're going to kill me". "I can't - her sister reply - I love you". "Look - I say - we all should sleep. Have a good night". "Good night - Marghe says - just stop touching me".<br>"...marghe no one is touching you..."</p>

        <p>[16/7/17] La faro' corta: quella mattina, qualche ora dopo il nostro risveglio, avevamo trovato nella nostra tenda un preservativo usato, accuratamente annodato alla base. La tenda era vuota, l'entrata spalancata, e i nostri sospetti su uno scherzo di pessimo gusto. <br>Avvertimmo i nostri genitori, per supporto morale al fatto, tra chi si aggirava disgustato e chi rideva di gusto. E non l'avessimo mai fatto: la breaking new girava su tutte le bocche della famiglia Defferrari, e ogni bocca, collegata a un cervello, decideva che era buono e giusto scassare la povera famigliare in vacanza. <br>E cosi', seduti a un bar a giocare a uno con Yara e un altro Yelf, ci ritrovammo a dover interrompere l'attivita' per spiegare alla prozia che sua pronipote era sopravvissuta vergine al fattaccio. <br>E, da unico in grado di saper parlare inglese con gli Yelf, mi tocco' raccontare l'interessante disavventura a Yara Yelf. <br>"So, this morning, when we woke up - dissi a bassa voce - we found in our tent a condom - an used condom". Yara mi guardo' con il tipico sguardo nato tra il rapporto bastardo di confusione e stupore. Messi per un attimo in dubbio la conoscenza e l'inglese della nata svizzera. "Do you know what a condom is?" chiesi tranquillo. "Uh, yeah" rispose intimidita lei. "CONDOM!" urlo'19        il piu giovane Yelf, come in preda da un'ispirazione. "Condom!" urlai io di rilancio. "Yeah, - continuai imperterrito io - we told her parents, and now everyone's worried". <br>Lei, timida, alzo' lievemente un dito verso di me. "Was it yours?" chiese, seria.<br>'Fuck', realizzai mentalmente. 'I just said I fucked her best friend' capii.<br>"It was not mine. It was not mine. I swear it was not mine" dissi immediatamente.<br>Yara sorrise dolcemente, voltandosi verso un altro ragazzo conosciuto in giornata, non del posto.<br>"Was it yours then?". <br>That's what she said.</p>
